# Cambrian – AI Music Marketplace *(In Development)*

Cambrian is a full-stack platform that allows creators to upload, license, and sell AI-generated music. It provides a marketplace where buyers can browse, preview, and purchase tracks, while creators manage their catalogue, set licensing terms, and receive payouts — all through a clean, modern interface.
